# Kald-s-Arduino-Projects
This repository contains Arduino projects I made for my school's robotics course.
<br>
<b>Note!</b> Code comments as well as reports in .docx format are currently in Estonian. Translations to English are scheduled to come out in the future.

This repository consists of multiple projects, each located in a separate folder named after the excercise number. 
As I create new projects, this repository will be updated with new projects.
